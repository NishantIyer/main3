I'm Nishant, a highly driven executive and founder of Portena systems, the world's foremost remote compute architecture and an avid tech enthusiast. 

From an early age, I demonstrated an innate proclivity for computer science and information technology. At just 7 years old, I was actively engaged in [robotic systems engineering](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1idyy4DyDHI7uGDj3E00iVGRDthxPJJ2b?usp=drive_link), designing and constructing autonomous bots on a weekly basis for academic exhibitions. This whetted my appetite for more sophisticated technical pursuits across a range of domains. Through self-study and hands-on experience, I rapidly acquired proficiency in numerous programming languages, networking protocols, cloud platforms and virtualization technologies.

My core competencies lie in designing and developing [cloud-native](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#cloud) solutions on AWS and Alibaba Cloud. With extensive production-level experience with prominent landscapes of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/), I tackle challenges in resource allocation, horizontal scalling, container orchestration, service mesh, database management, while engineering fault-tolerant distributed ledger instances. I have also built and authored numerous cloud-based opensource solutions like modules and plugins, marketplace images for pen-testers and fostered multi-cloud intergraions. My recent works include developing CoaaS, serverless and cost-effective cloud infrastructure for personal use cases. 

[Virtualization](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#virtualization) is the dearest of mine. I have designed and implemented VDI environments in financial networks, hypervisor clusters using KVM and Xen, and contributed to the development of many marketplace Docker repositories at [Alibaba](https://github.com/NishantIyer). My recent works include the development of a novel remote compute architecture that utilizes KVM to manage instances on the server-side

I possess programming proficiency in [Python](https://www.python.org/), a little bit of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and have a working knowledge of C and Java. I possess deep competencies in systems programming, having contributed extensively to open source projects like [fedora](https://pagure.io/user/nishantiyer). Networking is another forte, including network configuration and management, and network security mechanisms. Lately, I have been working a lot around remote connection protocols and got quite a good grasp of concepts there.

[Virtualization](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#virtualization) is the dearest of mine. I have designed and implemented VDI environments in financial networks, hypervisor clusters using KVM and Xen, and contributed to the development of many marketplace Docker repositories at [Alibaba](https://github.com/NishantIyer).

My work in [blockchain technology](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#blockchain) runs deep, having been an early contributor to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), and other leading platforms where I have developed many utilities.

I am also proficient in managing and developing [Linux environments](https://pagure.io/user/nishantiyer) and have a particular fondness for Arch, including shell scripting.

I have also immersed myself in the field of [Bot Development](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#bots-nlp-transformers) and transformer models, having developed many [Discord](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#bots-nlp-transformers) and Telegram bots. I have also created a few transformer models and implemented them for various utilities. I specialize in GPT fine-tuning, coherence tuning, and prompt engineering.

Academically, I have consistently excelled while maintaining a balance between my studies and work. I have been involved in many programs from esteemed institutions such as [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/blockchain-disruptive-technology) and [Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch) by auditing them online, seeking to do more.

I have also participated in many coding competitions, hackathons, and CTFs, ranking highly as an Eulerian.

During downtime, I engage myself with some deep philosophical thoughts, analyzing stocks, practicing calisthenics, hitting the gym, and playing the keys.

Presently, I am grinding on the development of my brainchild, [Portena](https://portena.netlify.app) - A revolutionary and first-of-its-kind remote desktop architecture.
