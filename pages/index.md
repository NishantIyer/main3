Hey, I am Nishant Iyer

As a precocious 14-year-old, I fell in love with the binary world from a very young age. I started building robotic systems in second grade, and my journey in the industry has led me to explore diverse domains, ranging from web development and blockchain engineering to network protocol specialization and application security. Proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Haskell, I have leveraged my programming skills to develop frameworks, blockchain-based applications, and advanced Discord bots. As a staunch supporter of open source, I have made significant contributions to renowned projects and organizations such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and [Cardano](https://cardano.org), where I have built robust financial infrastructures.

My expertise extends to the intricate landscapes of cloud computing, with a comprehensive understanding of prominent platforms like AWS, GCP, Alibaba Cloud, and Azure. This proficiency empowers me to adeptly navigate resource allocation challenges and construct fault-tolerant ledgers. Additionally, I am skilled in using Linux/Unix systems (by the way, I use Arch ;)).

Academically, I have consistently excelled, and I am currently studying in 10th grade. I have also participated in many coding competitions, hackathons, and CTFs, ranking highly as a Eulerian. Moreover, I have actively pursued online courses and obtained professional certifications from esteemed institutions such as [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/blockchain-disruptive-technology) and [Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch), all while going to high school.

Beyond the world of technology, I have dedicated eight years of my life to training and practicing Taekwondo, achieving a black belt, and I'm also a regular practitioner of calisthenics. In my free time...I enjoy playing the keys and engaging myself with some deep philosophical thoughts and books :)

Presently, I am grinding in the development of my brainchild - Portena (parent - Portcom) - which has the potential to redefine personal computing. Portena represents a complex remote architecture solution that leverages the power of edge compute (CoaaS) to seamlessly connect to powerful and scalable instances without the need for physical hardware, using my unique remote connection protocol. By the implementation of my DRATP (Dynamic Resource Allocation and Task Prioritization) model, Portena has the potential to reduce the cost of owning a PC by a staggering 60%. This groundbreaking innovation is the first of its kind in the world, showcasing its novel and immense potential.

I am wholeheartedly dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology, and I believe that Portena is just the beginning of a remarkable journey toward transforming the way we perceive and utilize personal computing.

Join me in this venture as we chart new paths and unlock extraordinary possibilities in the realm of technology.
