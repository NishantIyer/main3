**Current Position**: **Founder, and Chief Engineer** at Client Architectures for Sustainable Computing and Digital Equity **(Cascade)**
**Ex Companies - Ethereum (2021-22). Cardano Community - DLT Engineer (2022).**

Nishant Iyer is presently engaged in the commercialization of Lubera, the **worldâ€™s first high performance desktop broker**, which he developed in response to a complex triad of hitherto unsolved and complex engineering challenges. After noticing a market gap in December 2022, his initial efforts met setbacks and impasses, but through perseverance and thousands of hours of engineering work, he solved the multi-million dollar problem statement in **late 2023**. Leveraging a suite of proprietary protocols, hardware, client-server systems and architectures, he is at the vanguard of enabling the development, deployment, and utilization of graphical shells and software within extremely resource-constrained environments.

To date, he has filed **several patent** applications in IPO, and USTPO, with more in preparation to cover future expenses via VCs. His focus remains fixed on identifying and serving **high-impact market segments**, industries and modes of deployment. One such effort is **EMBERY** (Equalizing Means of Bringing Educational Resources to Youth), which provides Lubera-enabled computers to youth for educational purposes; his expertise have reduced total cost of ownership by over 76% compared to competing offerings by Dell and HP. **Experts thus deem Lubera one of the most significant engineering advances since 2020.**

However, proprietary aspects of the stack presently limit cross-platform software support relative to dominant operating systems like Windows, MacOS and Android. Lack of software compatibility poses the biggest obstacle, which he intensely works to mitigate by incorporating as much third-party software as possible into a minimum viable product.

His technical foundation, established from age 6, encompasses diverse computing and corporate concepts including IT infrastructure, computing architectures, systems architecture, firmware development, virtualization, distributed systems, cloud services, data management, platform development, corporate governance, intellectual property and product innovation.

Beyond his core efforts, his community involvement includes moderating developer forums to encourage healthy technical debate, contributing open source code, and advisory engagements.
