I'm Nishant, a highly driven executive and founder of Portena systems, the world's foremost remote compute architecture and an avid tech enthusiast. 
From an early age, I demonstrated an innate proclivity for computer science and information technology. At just 7 years old, I was actively engaged in [robotic systems engineering](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1idyy4DyDHI7uGDj3E00iVGRDthxPJJ2b?usp=drive_link), designing and constructing autonomous bots on a weekly basis for academic exhibitions. This whetted my appetite for more sophisticated technical pursuits across a range of domains. Through diligent self-study, I rapidly acquired proficiency in numerous programming languages, networking protocols, cloud platforms and virtualization technologies.

I possess programming proficiency in [Python](https://www.python.org/), a little bit of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and have a working knowledge of C and Java. I possess deep competencies in systems programming, having contributed extensively to open source projects like [fedora](https://pagure.io/user/nishantiyer). Networking is another forte, including network configuration and management, and network security mechanisms. Lately, I have been working a lot around remote connection protocols and got quite a good grasp of concepts there.

In [cloud computing](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#cloud), I have production-level experience with prominent landscapes of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/). Having experience of over 1 year in developing and maintaining highly available and fault-tolerant distributed systems. I have authored dozens of open source complex cloud-based solutions handling massive scale and throughput.I tackle challenges in resource allocation, horizontal scaling, container orchestration, service mesh, and database management, while engineering fault-tolerant distributed ledger systems. I have also built and authored a few cloud-based opensource solutions like modules and plugins, marketplace images for pen-testers and fostered multi-cloud integrations. My recent works includes developing CoaaS, a server-less and cost-effective cloud infra architecture for personal use cases.

[Virtualization](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#virtualization) is the dearest of mine. I have designed and implemented VDI environments in financial networks, hypervisor clusters using KVM and Xen, and contributed to the development of many marketplace Docker repositories at [Alibaba](https://github.com/NishantIyer).

My work in [blockchain technology](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#blockchain) runs deep, having been an early contributor to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), and other leading platforms where I have developed many utilities.

I am also proficient in managing and developing [Linux environments](https://pagure.io/user/nishantiyer) and have a particular fondness for Arch, including shell scripting.

I have also immersed myself in the field of [Bot Development](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#bots-nlp-transformers) and transformer models, having developed many [Discord](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#bots-nlp-transformers) and Telegram bots. I have also created a few transformer models and implemented them for various utilities. I specialize in GPT fine-tuning, coherence tuning, and prompt engineering.

Academically, I have consistently excelled while maintaining a balance between my studies and work. I have been involved in many programs from esteemed institutions such as [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/blockchain-disruptive-technology) and [Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch) by auditing them online, seeking to do more.

I have also participated in many coding competitions, hackathons, and CTFs, ranking highly as an Eulerian.

Presently, I am grinding on the development of my brainchild, [Portena](https://portena.netlify.app) - A revolutionary and first-of-its-kind remote desktop architecture.

Portena is a distributed cloud computing system that employs advanced virtualization, networking, and resource management techniques to provide users with seamless and secure remote computing experiences. Its dynamic resource allocation and task prioritization (DRATP) algorithm is a multi-dimensional optimization model that dynamically allocates resources to virtual machines based on their priority, usage, and time-varying workload. It uses advanced queuing theory, stochastic optimization, and machine learning techniques to optimize resource allocation and ensure that each virtual machine has the necessary resources to perform its tasks efficiently.

Portena's elastic resource balancing (ERB) server is a distributed resource management system that balances the resource usage across different physical servers in real-time, based on the workload and resource availability. It uses a novel and scalable balloon-like container model that dynamically partitions resources across containers based on their size, priority, and resource requirements. The container model is based on advanced queuing theory, non-linear optimization, and control theory techniques that ensure each container has the necessary resources to perform its tasks while minimizing waste and resource contention.

The context-aware compression and data formatting (CACF) server is a distributed data processing system that compresses and formats data in a way that optimizes its transmission over low-bandwidth networks while minimizing latency. It uses advanced machine learning, signal processing, and information theory techniques to learn the statistical properties of data, model their context, and compress and format the data in a way that minimizes their entropy and redundancy. The CACF server also uses advanced predictive modeling techniques to anticipate future data requirements and pre-fetch and pre-cache data to reduce latency and improve the user experience.

The predictive caching and adaptive error correction (PCAEC) server is a distributed caching and error correction system that predicts user behavior and caches frequently accessed data to reduce latency and improve the user experience. It uses advanced machine learning, data mining, and predictive modeling techniques to learn the patterns of user behavior, model their preferences, and cache data in a way that optimizes their access time and availability. The PCAEC server also uses adaptive error correction techniques that detect and correct errors in real-time, based on their type, location, and severity.

The adaptive bandwidth allocation (ABA) server is a distributed bandwidth management system that dynamically allocates bandwidth to different virtual machines based on their usage and priority. It uses advanced network flow optimization, queuing theory, and control theory techniques to optimize bandwidth allocation and ensure each virtual machine has the necessary bandwidth to perform its tasks efficiently. The ABA server also uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict future bandwidth requirements and allocate bandwidth proactively to reduce latency and improve the user experience.

Portena's SSL gateway is a distributed security system that provides secure communication between different servers in the network, using SSL encryption and authentication protocols. It uses advanced cryptography, key management, and authentication techniques to ensure data transmitted between servers is secure and protected from unauthorized access. The load balancer is a distributed load balancing system that distributes incoming network traffic across different servers in the network to ensure high availability and reliability. It uses advanced load balancing algorithms, network flow optimization, and control theory techniques to balance the load across different servers and prevent overloading.

The database server is a distributed database management system that stores and manages data related to user profiles, virtual machines, and system configurations. It uses advanced database management techniques, such as distributed transaction management, data replication, and consistency models, to ensure data consistency and integrity. The virtualization server is a distributed virtualization system that creates and manages virtual machines that provide users with remote computing environments. It uses advanced virtualization techniques, such as hardware-assisted virtualization, hypervisor-based virtualization, and container-based virtualization, to ensure each virtual machine has the necessary resources to perform its tasks efficiently.

The authentication server is a distributed authentication system that authenticates users and grants them access to the system based on their credentials and permissions. It uses advanced authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, SAML, and OAuth, to ensure only authorized users can access the system. The firewall and IDS server is a distributed security system that protects the network from unauthorized access and data breaches by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic and blocking suspicious activity. It uses advanced firewall and IDS techniques, such as packet filtering, stateful inspection, and anomaly detection, to detect and prevent intrusions.

The high-speed network switch is a distributed network switch that connects different servers in the network using high-speed, low-latency connections. It uses advanced networking technologies, such as InfiniBand, RDMA, and Jumbo frames, to ensure data can be transmitted quickly and efficiently between servers, minimizing latency and improving the user experience.

It is still in its nascent stages of development, and I'm working intensely towards its development.
