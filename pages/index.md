A 16 year old tech aficionado and ex-founder of Cascade Research which built the world's first and only Thin Client System that operated a high-functionality EMR (Electronic Medical Record) and Portcom Graphical Shell at sub dial bandwidths (100-200 kbps) and on bare-metal $15 SBC at high performance and visual fidelity which was significantly lower than the requirements of other industry solutions to operate the same. In many ways, Low Bandwidth Remote Architecture (LUBERA) is considered a significant engineering breakthrough. 

I embarked on my programming journey at the age of 6, and since then, I've honed my proficiency across diverse domains concerning the following.
