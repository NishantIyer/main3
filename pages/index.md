# Hey, I am Nishant Iyer

As a precocious 14-year-old, I fell in love with the binary world from a very young age. I started building [robotic systems]('https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1idyy4DyDHI7uGDj3E00iVGRDthxPJJ2b?usp=drive_link') in second grade and my journey in the industry has led me to explore diverse domains, ranging from [web development]('https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#web-apps') and [blockchain engineering]('https://ethereum.org') to [network protocol specialization]('https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#networking') and application security. Proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Haskell, I have leveraged my programming skills to develop frameworks, blockchain-based applications, and advanced [Discord bots]('https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#bots-nlp-transformers'). As a staunch supporter of open source, I have made significant contributions to renowned projects and organizations such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and [Cardano](https://cardano.org), where I have built robust financial infrastructures.

My expertise extends to the intricate landscapes of [cloud computing](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#cloud), with a comprehensive understanding of prominent platforms like AWS, GCP, Alibaba Cloud, and Azure. This proficiency empowers me to adeptly navigate resource allocation challenges and construct fault-tolerant ledgers. Additionally, I am skilled in using Linux/Unix systems (by the way, I use Arch ;)).

Academically, I have consistently excelled, and I am currently studying in 10th grade. I have also participated in many coding competitions, hackathons, and CTFs, ranking highly as an [Eulerian]('https://projecteuler.net/about'). Moreover, I have actively pursued online courses and obtained professional certifications from esteemed institutions such as [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/blockchain-disruptive-technology) and [Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch), all while going to high school.

Beyond the world of technology, I have dedicated eight years of my life to training and practicing Taekwondo, achieving a black belt, and I'm also a regular practitioner of calisthenics. In my free time, I enjoy playing the keys and engaging myself with some deep philosophical thoughts and books :)

Presently, I'm working on my own entreprenuerial venture - [Portena](https://portena.netlify.app)
