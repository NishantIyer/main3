As an individual with a precocious interest in computers since the age of 7, I have developed a deep passion for the field of IT. Starting with building [robotic systems](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1idyy4DyDHI7uGDj3E00iVGRDthxPJJ2b?usp=drive_link) for my school every week, I slowly diverged into various domains. Through self-mastery and consistent self-learning, I have established a strong foundation in numerous technical concepts.

I possess programming proficiency in Python, a little bit of JavaScript, and have a working knowledge of C and Java. [Networking and management](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#networking) and configurations for app security and containers are among my top skills.

[Cloud computing](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#cloud) is another area where I have gained competence. With a comprehensive understanding of platforms like AWS and Alibaba Cloud, I can address resource allocation challenges and construct HA and FT decentralized ledgers. I have also built many projects on Alibaba Cloud; you can check them out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/NishantIyer).

Virtualization is a field I love a lot and play around with, having experience in the configuration and development of VDIs for financial networks. I can also build efficient virtualized environments using Qemu and KVM.

I have worked in the field of blockchain for 2 years, actively contributing to open-source organizations like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org). This has involved developing a lightweight trading bot and a few backend API frameworks. I am also proficient in managing and developing [Linux environments](https://pagure.io/user/nishantiyer) and have a particular fondness for Arch, including shell scripting.

I have also immersed myself in the field of Bot Development and transformer models, having developed many [Discord](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#bots-nlp-transformers) and Telegram bots. I have also created a few [transformer models](https://github.com/NishantIyer/proxie) and implemented them for various utilities. I specialize in GPT fine-tuning, coherence tuning, and prompt engineering.

Academically, I have consistently excelled while maintaining a balance between my studies and work. I have been involved in many programs from esteemed institutions such as [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/blockchain-disruptive-technology) and [Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch) by auditing them online, seeking to do more.

Beyond the realm of technology, I have dedicated eight years of my life to training and practicing Taekwondo, achieving a black belt. Additionally, I regularly engage in calisthenics to challenge myself or hit the gym. In my free time, I enjoy playing the keys and engaging myself in deep philosophical thoughts and books.

Presently, I am focused on the development of my brainchild, [Portena](https://portena.netlify.app) - A revolutionary and first-of-its-kind remote desktop architecture.
