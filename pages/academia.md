## Early Intellectual Abilities

During my early years before I started programming and robotics, I demonstrated insatiable curiosity towards learning subjects of higher grades from my elder sister's textbooks. This appetite for knowledge resulted in a substantial collection of notebooks on advanced topics in chemistry and mathematics. In second grade, I memorized the entire periodic table and recited it in front of the entire school in the assembly. The very next day, I even learned all its symbols and valencies, astonishing my teachers. Followed by this, I memorized the...

## Love for Computers

While in my primary grades, my fascination took a turn towards robotics. I used to build a project every week (you can have a look at them in the gallery section) and showcase them. You may also find them in Arduino's Project Hub. I learned everything through YouTube tutorials and documentations.

## Self-learning and Programming

An intriguing aspect of my coding journey is that I have not had the privilege of a formal teacher or mentor guiding me through the process. Instead, I have independently acquired my coding skills through diligent self-study using online resources.

## Entrepreneurial Venture

Presently, I am fully immersed in the development of an innovative project called Portena (parent - Portcom), which has the potential to revolutionize the realm of personal computing. Portena introduces a groundbreaking remote desktop architecture solution that harnesses the capabilities of edge compute (CoaaS) to establish seamless connections with powerful and scalable instances, eliminating the need for physical hardware. This is achieved through the implementation of my proprietary remote connection protocol.

What sets Portena apart is its implementation of the DRATP (Dynamic Resource Allocation and Task Prioritization) model. This model intelligently allocates resources and prioritizes tasks, resulting in a remarkable cost reduction of up to 60% compared to traditional PC ownership. This pioneering approach positions Portena as a trailblazer in the field, showcasing its novel and immense potential.

I am deeply committed to advancing Portena, driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a desire to reshape the landscape of personal computing.
